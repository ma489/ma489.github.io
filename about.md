Hello! I'm Mansour, a Software Engineer.

I have significant experience in banking, adtech, e-commerce, supply chain management, and risk management. I hold a Computer Science degree from the University of Cambridge. 

I enjoy building software that is correct, robust, scalable, and solves interesting problems. I’m really into machine learning, functional programming, big data, and cloud computing. I’ve succeeded in both small startups and large corporations. I lead projects and enjoy mentoring engineers. I continually enhance my skills by keeping up with the latest tech developments by reading engineering blogs and technical books and attending meetups.

This is my personal engineering blog, where I mainly post about hobby projects, programming puzzles, my use of programming languages, and general musings on the tech industry. I hope you enjoy reading. Feedback is _always_ welcome. 

The views expressed are my own and not those of my employer.
