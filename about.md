Hello! I'm Mansour, an expat British Software Engineer living in New York City. I've worked in the domains of banking, ad tech, e-commerce and supply chain management. I hold a Computer Science degree from the University of Cambridge.

This is my personal engineering blog, where I mainly post about hobby projects, programming puzzles, my use of programming languages, and general musings on the tech industry.

I hope you enjoy reading. Feedback is always welcome. Views are, of course, my own.
