Hello! I'm Mansour, a British **Software Engineer** with a global outlook, now based in New York City.

I have significant engineering experience across diverse industries including cloud computing, banking, and e-commerce, having worked at companies such as [Google](https://www.google.com), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) and [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com). I earned my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), and my Master's in **Machine Learning & Data Science** from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk).

I enjoy building software that is correct, robust, scalable, and solves interesting problems. I’m really into **machine learning** and **functional programming**. I’ve succeeded in both small startups and large corporations. I lead projects and enjoy mentoring engineers. I continually enhance my skills by keeping up with the latest tech developments by reading engineering blogs and technical books and attending meetups.

This is my personal engineering blog, where I mainly post about hobby projects, programming puzzles, exploring programming languages, and general musings on the tech industry. I hope you enjoy reading. Feedback is always welcome.

Feel free to reach out via email if you’d like a copy of my **CV/résumé**.
