I built a web app to simulate the order-matching that happens at an exchange (according to the standard time and price precedence rules). I was inspired to build this after reading two books: [Trading & Exchanges](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Trading-Exchanges-Microstructure-Practitioners-Association-x/dp/0195144708) and [Flash Boys](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flash-Boys-Michael-Lewis/dp/0141981032)

Some of the technologies that went into making this: Python, MongoDB, [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), jQuery and [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). See a [live demo here](http://mansourahmed.co.uk/forex) and find [the source code here](https://github.com/ma489/forex)!
