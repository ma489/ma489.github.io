As the year draws to end, I've been reflecting on the all the new things I've learnt. Below is a list of some of the good books I've read over the last year (a mix of old and new), that I would recommend. As ever, I've been making full use of my Safari Books subscription, but I'm attaching Amazon links here for simplicity.
