A P2P chat app for Android. You can start a server locally, or connect to one, and exchange messages. Nothing ground-breaking, but it was a good way for me to learn more about the Android platform.

It was also interesting thinking about things that one normally doesn&#8217;t when developing, but become a consideration when developing for a mobile system (things like battery power!)
