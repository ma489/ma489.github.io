In keeping with (my relatively) recent tradition, here's my annual retrospective recommended reading list. It's a shorter list than usual (just three books this time), but do check them out.

- [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable)
- [Brit(ish)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Brit-ish-Race-Identity-Belonging/dp/1911214284)
- [Even You Can Learn Statistics and Analytics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Even-You-Learn-Statistics-Analytics/dp/0133382664)
