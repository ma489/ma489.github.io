This year I discovered I could get Kindle ebooks through my local public library! I also joined a book club, which has been useful in diversifying the range of books I read. I’m also starting to learn how to abandon books part-way that I no longer enjoy reading - rather than finishing them _just because_ I started (I’m no longer convinced this is a good thing).
