I recently completed the [Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), taught byÂ [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng)Â (an excellent teacher). It was a good way to refresh my knowledge on machine learningÂ and get hands-on.

I would post my source code up but that would go against the spirit of Coursera and it&#8217;s honour code. Instead here&#8217;s my certificate ðŸ™‚
