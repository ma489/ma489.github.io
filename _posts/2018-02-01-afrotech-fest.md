I very much enjoyed attending [Afrotech Fest](https://www.afrotechfest.co.uk/) in London recently. It was "a two-day tech festival by and for black people of African and Caribbean heritage", with an exciting programme of events including thought-provoking talks, panels and workshops.

I think an event like this was vitally needed: various, laudable, efforts have been made to address issues of diversity & inclusion in the technology industry, but [BAME](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bame) Britons are rarely the focus of these efforts. It was inspiring and re-energising to meet others from this under-represented community, and celebrate their talents in a unique, open-minded and intellectual setting.

I applaud the work of the organisers of this successful event, and look forward to returning next year!
