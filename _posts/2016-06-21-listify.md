Listify is a [Web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) that combines information from the [BBC radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio) schedule with the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/), to automate the creation of Spotify playlists from radio shows.

I was motivated to build it because I realised that what I love about the radio shows that I listen to is _the music_, and not the filler content in between (talk, ad breaks, etc.), and so by using Listify, I could distil those shows and extract that desired essence.

This project was a great way to learn a bunch of technologies from the world of isomorphic [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript): [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [ moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/) (thank goodness for [async/await](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/10/asyncawait-the-hero-javascript-deserved.html)). I also dived into [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).

To use Listify, just login with your Spotify account and get going! Check it out [in action here](http://mansourahmed.co.uk/listify), and find the [source code here](https://github.com/ma489/listify)!
