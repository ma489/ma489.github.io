After reading [this inspiring blog by Haseeb Q](http://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/), I decided to have a go at coding some solutions to [the eight queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). You can [find my source code here](https://github.com/ma489/eight-queens) (alas, no pretty GUI)

I think its really a interesting problem because there are a number of different approaches to solving it; e.g. an exhaustive approach like depth-first [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking), or an iterative improvement approach such as hill-climbing with the [min-conflicts heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-conflicts_algorithm) (which is faster but risks hitting a local optimum).
