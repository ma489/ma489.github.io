So, I've begun another chapter in life: I've moved from London to New York City. A huge move geographically, but not a huge difference culturally (really, two big cities). I am keen to explore the tech scene here further, I'm sure its just as vibrant as the one back home. I've also set myself some personal growth goals while I'm out here, and perhaps this blog post will hold me accountable(!). Onwards!
