I&#8217;ve just returned from [MuniHac](http://munihac.de/), a three-day [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)) hackathon in Munich, Germany. It was hosted by the good people at [TNG](https://www.tngtech.com/en.html) and [Well-Typed](http://www.well-typed.com/).

There were lots of [different projects](https://wiki.haskell.org/MuniHac2016/Projects) going on. I contributed to [Leksah](http://leksah.org/), an [open-source](https://github.com/leksah/leksah) Haskell IDE written in Haskell; specifically by adding functionality to select snippets of code and upload to [LPaste](http://lpaste.net/) (a [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/)-like service designed with Haskell in mind), returning the URL to the user to share.

The coding was punctuated with talks by guest speakers from the Haskell community, as well as social activities. Plus it was great to catch up with some old friends from Utrecht. I had a blast!
