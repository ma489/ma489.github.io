Another year, another retrospective reading list. With the ongoing pandemic, I have found myself reading more. I have continued with the trend of leaning towards audiobooks (I think this format works really well for non-fiction that is not _too_ technical). This year, the list is mostly a mix of pop-science and racism analyses.

As usual, this isn't necessarily an endorsement of any of these books, but I hope, at least, that you might find them interesting to read.
