I just spent four days hanging with the (very international) Haskell community in London.

First I attended the two-day [Haskell eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7276-haskell-exchange-2016) conference. This was in fact my _very first_ conference! I watched talks on a range of topics, ranging from notation for category theory to the use of Haskell for games and web development, and even got [hands-on in a workshop](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/8759-hands-on-tutorial-build-yourself-a-reddit-bot). Good fun! The highlights were of course the keynotes (I was left mind-blown by [this one](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/8893-is-a-type-a-lifebuoy-or-a-lamp)). All the videos are now [available online](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7276-haskell-exchange-2016#program).

After that, there was [HaskellXHack](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8379-haskell-exchange-hackathon-2016), a two-day hackathon focused on improving the Haskell infrastructure ([Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/), [Cabal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabal_(software)), etc.). I paired up with another developer to contribute to [Hackage](https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server); we looked at a couple issues around rendering webpage content and raised [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to fix them.

It was great seeing many friendly, familiar faces from Munich and Utrecht. I&#8217;ll definitely be back next year!
