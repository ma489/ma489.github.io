As the year draws to end, I've been reflecting on the all the new things I've learnt. Below is a list of some of the good books I've read over the last year, that I would recommend. It's a mix of old and new, technical and finance-related (the domain I work in). I've been making good use of my Safari Books subscription, but I'm attaching Amazon links here for simplicity.
