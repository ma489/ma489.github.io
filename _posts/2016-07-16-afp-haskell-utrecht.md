For two weeks in July, I attended the [Utrecht Summer School in Applied Functional Programming](https://www.utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/science/applied-functional-programming-in-haskell) at [Utrecht University](http://www.uu.nl/en) in the Netherlands. It was taught by some of the leading academics in the field of functional programming, and combined a [good mix of theory and practice](http://foswiki.cs.uu.nl/foswiki/USCS/CourseSchedule). Overall, a very informative and enjoyable experience!

I worked on several theoretical exercises and mini-projects, all implemented in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), and you can find [the source code here!](https://github.com/ma489/afp) I&#8217;ve hooked the Github repo up with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to build the code and run the tests ([compilation is a big deal](https://wiki.haskell.org/Why_Haskell_just_works) in Haskell). Note: if you setup a Haskell project on Travis, [be sure to read this](https://github.com/hvr/multi-ghc-travis) to avoid any [GHC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Haskell_Compiler) version trouble!

Aside: among the code, there is an implementation of [the board game Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) (with tests written in [HUnit](https://wiki.haskell.org/HUnit_1.0_User's_Guide) and [QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck)). Amusingly, there is an MTV reality [show loosely based on this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_the_One%3F) game!
