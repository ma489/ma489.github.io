I've returned from attending the [inaugural 'Alan Turing Lecture'](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/news/2019/inaugural-alan-turing-public-lecture-alan-turing-and-his-computational-universe), celebrating Turing's genius and pioneering Computer Science work. It was held at his (and incidentally mine) alma mater.

The [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) model is a very clever and accessible way of thinking about computation. An advantage it has over the equivalent (and elegant) [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), is that it is easier to do time complexity analysis.

I've left feeling inspired and re-energised. Some parts of Software Engineering can sometimes feel like a poor approximation of Computer Science - it's always good to revive the connection ðŸ˜Š
