I decided to take a moment to reflect on what it’s been like, lessons learnt, and a view of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it’s been like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, I wildly underestimated how long this would all go on for (not a unique thought, I’m sure). I smile as I recall thinking it would just be a couple of weeks (I confidently left some snacks in my desk drawer!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d had some previous extended WFH experience: a few years ago, I worked from home for six weeks following a sports injury. And, of course, I regularly work on personal projects in my spare time from home. However, this was very different. To name but a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The uncertainty of when it would end made strategising difficult&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The lack of locations options of where one could work (one couldn’t just work in, say, a library or a coffee shop)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The general background stress of the ongoing pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was a bizarre year, to be sure. But, I must count my blessings. So, here’s an attempt at a balanced view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More time to the day since I reclaimed my commute time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A chance to take stock and focus on the most valuable tasks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cold, snowy NYC winter made not having to leave my home quite appealing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not collaborating in certain ways, such as spontaneous ‘whiteboarding’ or ‘hallway conversations.’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collegial coffee breaks aren’t quite the same over video call(!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Missing out on commute-specific productivity (no phone signal? no problem!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Needing to recreate the structure and routine that a conventional in-office workday naturally provides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons learnt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the circumstances which brought about this shift to WFH never recur. But should I find myself WFH for an extended period again, for whatever reason, I’ll leave a note to myself with some helpful tips to hit the ground running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepare a good home office setup.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A spacious desk, comfortable chair, large monitor, and quality headphones/microphone will make the entire experience better.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a professional background for video calls and meetings.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Alternatively, configure a virtual one on your video call client.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;While I envy those with imposing bookshelves filled with weighty tomes as backgrounds, small New York City apartments don’t quite allow for that(!)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recapture the value of commute time.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;My subway rides used to be quite productive: I would read books, listen to podcasts, respond to emails; the morning commute was a great way to get a headstart on the day, and the evening commute was a great way to decompress between the office and home.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Recreate this experience by going for a walk around your neighbourhood at the start and end of your workday.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take well-earned breaks.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Be sure to take both small coffee breaks during the day, as well as annual leave days off.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Self-care is vital both for your health and your productivity at work.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now go into the office one day per week, making for a nice change of scenery. Fortunately, I live within cycling distance of the office, and so I can avoid the subway!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With news of the rollout of multiple vaccines underway, I remain optimistic about the future. I look forward to a safe return to the office, whenever that might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictions of mass telecommuting have been around since the 1970s, and while 2020 certainly accelerated that, I don’t know if that trend will generally continue beyond the pandemic. From a personal perspective, I find that being together with my colleagues, present and in-person, maximises my collaboration, creativity, and productivity. Conversely, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2020/08/research-knowledge-workers-are-more-productive-from-home&quot;&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that that is not the case more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a human perspective, I think we’re fundamentally social beings who need to connect to others in a way that video calls can never really replace. That alone might provide the impetus to return to the office. I look forward to Normal.&lt;/p&gt;

I found it to be a rewarding and successful experience. While I had had various internships myself years ago, this was my first time being on &lt;em&gt;the other side&lt;/em&gt;. This post is a summary and reflection of that time, and hopefully a chance to share some tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before they arrive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some initial housekeeping will ensure a smooth start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email them before their first day to introduce yourself and prepare any necessary logistics. It may be their first job, and the world of work can seem new and daunting; the smallest gestures can help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decide on the project that they’ll be working on. Give them ‘real work’: a meaningful project with real impact (i.e., it’s &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; of value to your team) and that can be practically completed in the internship duration. However, you might like to consider keeping the deliverables off the ‘critical path.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting your intern up for success:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a structured onboarding plan: you’ll likely need to introduce them to new technologies, processes, and cultures, and these may differ from their university experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take the time to explain the project they’ll be working on thoroughly and walk them through any existing systems they’ll be working with/within. To quote Sagan, “There is no such thing as a dumb question.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Draw up a list of estimated weekly milestones for the internship program. This will help to give structure, set the pace, and track progress. It will also help to set expectations and identify any stretch goals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have an early conversation to figure out the best management style (e.g., will it be hands-on or hands-off?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Into the swing of things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the internship progresses, be sure to keep the momentum going:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check-in regularly. For example, in the form of regular 1:1s and project progress sync-ups (these are distinct). Be sure to avoid micromanagement!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be responsive when they ‘ping’ you with questions or issues (you’ll probably be able to unblock them fairly quickly).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proactively reach out, as they may sometimes be too unconfident to ask for help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow along with their progress by reviewing their code, and offer constructive, actionable feedback where necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give them exposure to many different people in different roles in your team or company, including on the ‘business-side.’ This adds to their experience and knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Invite them to sit in on important meetings to watch ‘real-world’ decision-making in action.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Halfway through the internship, have a ‘mid-point review’. This is an excellent opportunity to offer and receive feedback and gives plenty of time to act on it during the program’s remainder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have fun! Schedule in some team-bonding, e.g., a team lunch, or play pool in your office games room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The end&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the internship draws to a close:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If they have to give an end-of-internship presentation, offer to watch a rehearsal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a review meeting with the intern at the end. Ask them how they felt the experience went, give them feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a definitive &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt;. This could be in the form of a official send-off/farewell; perhaps you could say a few words to the team about the experience and thank the intern.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it’s welcome, keep in touch on LinkedIn. Good professional networking is rarely a bad idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it may be a non-trivial time commitment, mentoring an intern is an enriching experience, and I would highly recommend it. The benefits, while possibly long-term and indirect, are clear. To the company: it is a chance to gain some ‘home-grown’ talent (c.f. lateral hires); to the mentor: it is a chance to learn-by-teaching; to the intern: an opportunity to gain real-world experience as they start their career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a two-day conference on the programming language Haskell, and its use in industry. Below a brief summary of some of the talks that I found to be personal highlights, with links to the recordings - check them out! See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/10237-haskell-exchange-2018#program&quot;&gt;full programme here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;One of the keynotes, on how code is rapidly deployed to production at FB.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In the system described, they do this by pushing all their business logic into libraries which are compiled to shared objects, and then hot-swapping these updated shared objects and loading into the main program on demand.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This approach is required for use-cases such as abuse-detection (removing abusive content posted by users) where they need to deploy updated logic/rules/heuristics ASAP in response to some new threat (in seconds), and they cannot tolerate longer times associated with a full deployment (i.e. restarting machines, reconnecting to dependent services, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;He also mentioned how they have a tool in their code review system that will run the code-presented-for-review against some simulated production traffic replay and report back performance stats. Nice! (&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.fb.com/developer-tools/sapienz-intelligent-automated-software-testing-at-scale/&quot;&gt;Related?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/12589-headfirst-into-haskell&quot;&gt;Headfirst into Haskell&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;An honest experience report based on the speaker’s first year working with Haskell.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;One interesting topic touched on is that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.aurynn.com/2015/12/16-contempt-culture&quot;&gt;Contempt Culture&lt;/a&gt;; for example looking down at people who use other programming languages, and the closed-mindedness that ensues. Contempt Culture disproportionately affects those who are under-represented minorities in Tech, who may have taken non-traditional routes into the industry.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The speaker presents his view on what has setup his organisation for success in building their cryptocurrency/platform.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Its developed in Haskell, and he describes how that’s made it a success: Haskell programmers tend to be more sympathetic to the world of mathematics and academic rigor, which is necessary in defining and solving the underlying engineering problems that arise when building blockchain systems (engineering problems around distributed systems, networking, etc., as well as finance/economics/regulatory concerns)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/&quot;&gt;Liquid Haskell&lt;/a&gt; is an extension to the Haskell language that allows you to prove things about your code, which are then confirmed at compile time.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For example, if you had a function that given a list, returned the head of a list, but wanted it to not throw a runtime exception in the case that the list was empty, then using Liquid Haskell you could: encode as a type the notion of a non-empty list, and then annotate your function with a precondition to say that this function only takes non-empty lists. This check would then instead throw a compile-time error if that condition is violated, which can be dealt with more readily.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

A two-day conference on the very interesting topic of &lt;em&gt;Big Code&lt;/em&gt;, which featured a mix of academic and industry speakers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigcodesummit.splashthat.com/&quot;&gt;See here&lt;/a&gt; for a link to the full programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By analogy to Big Data, &lt;em&gt;Big Code&lt;/em&gt; is the research area on how to manage large amounts of code in an organization and how best to deal with the complexities that come with that, as well as how to treat your code as data and leverage that large corpus to gain insights into how engineers can work better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are summary notes on some of the talks that I found to be personal highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3211353&quot;&gt;Neural code search&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Using NLP and IR techniques to search through code&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://software-lab.org/publications/oopsla2018_DeepBugs.pdf&quot;&gt;Learning to find Bugs&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Using ML to detect bugs in code. This is done by formalizing bug-finding as a classification problem: is this code buggy or non-buggy? In contrast, static analysis bug detectors fall short as they are coded to look for specific patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/michaelpradel/DeepBugs&quot;&gt;DeepBugs&lt;/a&gt; is trained on a labeled code corpus (given snippet of code, label is buggy/non-buggy), and so can learn more general rules. Fortunately, these labels come naturally from source version histories: if a given commit has a bug, then there will be a dual, follow-up commit that fixes the bug. It can even suggest fixes to the bug, based on information from source version history (e.g. commit x had a bug, commit y fixes the bug, that delta is the bug-fix strategy).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/talks/learning4programs/&quot;&gt;Learning for Programs: Connecting code, statistics, semantics, and language&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A broad-ranging talk, that touched on solving some interesting problems such as generating code comments from some given source snippet, or detecting redundant/inaccurate comments by comparison to their adjacent source code.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pavol-bielik.github.io/data/slides/BigCodeWorkshop'18.pdf&quot;&gt;Generate program UIs from design layouts&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Given an image from a UI designer, use ML to generate code that creates that UI. This is to save developers time/effort in producing UIs, and reduce inconsistencies from eye-balling.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05698.pdf&quot;&gt;Neural sketch learning&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;All about generating source code given some conditions (syntactic/semantic constraints) that the desired target source code must satisfy. Check out (&lt;a href=&quot;http://askbayou.com/&quot;&gt;Bayou&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://info.askbayou.com/how-to-use-bayou/&quot;&gt;more info&lt;/a&gt;); which can be used to generate Java code that follows API-calling idioms.&lt;/li&gt;

It was ”a two-day tech festival by and for black people of African and Caribbean heritage”, with an exciting programme of events including thought-provoking talks, panels and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think an event like this was vitally needed: various, laudable, efforts have been made to address issues of diversity &amp;amp; inclusion in the technology industry, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bame&quot;&gt;BAME&lt;/a&gt; Britons are rarely the focus of these efforts. It was inspiring and re-energising to meet others from this under-represented community, and celebrate their talents in a unique, open-minded and intellectual setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applaud the work of the organisers of this successful event, and look forward to returning next year!&lt;/p&gt;
